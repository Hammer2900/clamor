I. INTRODUCTION
As you already know, Clamor is a completely open source, accountless forum software. But what can it DO? To begin with, when you're on the home page of a Clamor forum, you'll see a list of channels. Click on any channel and you'll be taken to the channel's page. On that page, you're able to write a new post, and you can see the previous 50 posts arranged newest at the top, oldest at the bottom.
You'll note at this point that you don't even need an account to post. Just pick a nickname, and voice your thoughts! But, you ask, how is it moderated? Clamor's moderation system is fairly unique. There are three levels of moderators:
	1. Moderator (can delete posts, ban users, and view user IPs)
	2. Admin (can do everything that a mod can do, but can also add new moderator accounts and promote/demote existing moderators and admins)
	3. Owner (can do everything that an admin can do, except can't be demoted)
A Clamor distro will only ever have 1 owner. The only thing that sets the owner apart from the admin is the owner's impunity. People who post to the forum are monitored via their recorded IP addresses. With a simple click, a moderator can view all the posts from a user's IP, and can even delete any post. With a few more clicks, a moderator can ban an offender's IP.
In order for someone to be a moderator, their account must first be created by an admin. After that, the admin can also promote a mod to admin, demote an admin to mod, or even delete an admin account. The owner is absolute to prevent an admin from hijacking a Clamor forum.

II. FAQ
	1. What inspired Clamor?
		a. To be honest, my primary inspiration was 4chan. Although I never go on 4chan and don't recommend you do either, I liked the basic concept behind it. I originally marketed Clamor as a sort of chatbox, but I like the term "microforum" better.
	2. Can I do whatever I want with it?
		a. Yep! Just give the software credit in a way that neither expresses no implies that I condone your use of it. Also, follow the instructions in the conveniently provided LICENSE file.
	3. What if I don't want to use the moderation features?
		a. Don't then! But you do realize that 80% of my work coding Clamor was working on the easy-to-use moderation software, right? But if you really don't care about all my hard work, don't use it.
	4. Why did you choose Bottle?
		a. I especially liked the ease of use and installation. I wanted to start programming sites in Python, and it has gotten good press. Shortly after I discovered Bottle, I wanted to start a major project in it. I chose Clamor because I had already made a PHP version which wasn't nearly as advanced as I liked it.
	5. Who are you?
		a. I'm a hobbyist programmer who's been programming for over 4 years. I started with HTML, moved to JS, then PHP, and finally Python. Now, with a repertoir of 6 languages under my belt, I've decided to concentrate on a serious project.

I. DEPENDENCIES
	1. Windows/Mac/Linux
	2. Python 2.7.x
	3. Modules that aren't included in the standard Python distro (and where to find them):
		a. Bottle (bottlepy.com)
		b. Paste (pythonpaste.org) (OPTIONAL, SEE VERY BOTTOM OF "CLAMOR.PY")
		c. MySQLdb (sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python)
		d. Sessions (included in Clamor distro, under "sessions.py")
	4. MySQL 5.0 or above

II. SETUP
	1. Make sure you've read Section I (and acted upon it)
	2. Create a database on your MySQL server
	3. Run "db.sql" to prepare the database
	4. Change the variables at the beginning of "clamor.py"
	5. Make sure there are no conflicts on port 80 of your host
	6. Run "clamor.py"
	7. Open the web browser of your choice
	8. Navigate to "/admin" on your server
	9. Fill out and submit the form
	10. Explore the features of Clamor!

III. HOW TO SETUP THE PASTE SERVER
	When you're ready to go live and publish your microforum, the default Bottle server is like a bottleneck (pun intended), as it can only handle one request at a time. The best way to solve this problem is to use the Paste web server.
	1. Get Paste (pythonpaste.org)
	2. Uncomment the last line of "clamor.py"
	3. Comment out the third to last line of "clamor.py"
	4. Uncomment the line at the top of "clamor.py" where it says "from paste import httpserver"
	5. And you're ready to go!
