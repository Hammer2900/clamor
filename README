CLAMOR
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. DEPENDENCIES
	1. Windows/Mac/Linux
	2. Python 2.7.x
	3. Modules that aren't included in the standard Python distro (and where to find them):
		a. Bottle (bottlepy.com)
		b. Paste (pythonpaste.org) (OPTIONAL, SEE VERY BOTTOM OF "CLAMOR.PY")
		c. MySQLdb (sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python)
		d. Sessions (included in Clamor distro, under "sessions.py")
	4. MySQL 5.0 or above

II. SETUP
	1. Make sure you've read Section I (and acted upon it)
	2. Create a database on your MySQL server
	3. Run "db.sql" to prepare the database
	4. Change the variables at the beginning of "clamor.py"
	5. Make sure there are no conflicts on port 80 of your host
	6. Run "clamor.py"
	7. Open the web browser of your choice
	8. Navigate to "/admin" on your server
	9. Fill out and submit the form
	10. Explore the features of Clamor!

III. HOW TO SETUP THE PASTE SERVER
	When you're ready to go live and publish your microforum, the default Bottle server is like a bottleneck (pun intended), as it can only handle one request at a time. The best way to solve this problem is to use the Paste web server.
	1. Get Paste (pythonpaste.org)
	2. Uncomment the last line of "clamor.py"
	3. Comment out the third to last line of "clamor.py"
	4. Uncomment the line at the top of "clamor.py" where it says "from paste import httpserver"
	5. And you're ready to go!
